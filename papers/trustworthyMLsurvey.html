        <div class="citation-container">
        <p>The trustworthiness of machine learning has emerged as a critical topic in the field, encompassing
various applications and research areas such as robustness, security, interpretability, and fairness.
Over the past decade, dedicated efforts have been made to address these issues, resulting in a
proliferation of methods tailored to each specific challenge. In this survey paper, we provide a
systematic overview of the technical advancements in trustworthy machine learning, focusing on
robustness, adversarial robustness, interpretability, and fairness from a data-centric perspective, as
we believe that achieving trustworthiness in machine learning often involves overcoming challenges
posed by the data structures that traditional empirical risk minimization (ERM) training cannot
resolve.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, we observe a convergence of methods introduced from this perspective, despite their
development as independent solutions across various subfields of trustworthy machine learning. Furthermore, 
            we find that Pearl’s hierarchy of causality serves as a unifying framework for categorizing
these techniques. Consequently, this survey first presents the background of trustworthy machine
learning development using a unified set of concepts, connects this unified language to Pearl’s hierarchy 
            of causality, and finally discusses methods explicitly inspired by causality literature. By
doing so, we established a unified language with mathematical vocabulary as a principled connection
between these methods across robustness, adversarial robustness, interpretability, and fairness under
a data-centric perspective, fostering a more cohesive understanding of the field.</p>
<p>Further, we extend our study to the trustworthiness of large pretrained models. We first present
a brief summary of the dominant techniques in these models, such as fine-tuning, parameter-efficient
fine-tuning, prompting, and reinforcement learning with human feedback. We then connect these
techniques with standard ERM, upon which previous trustworthy machine learning solutions were
built. This connection allows us to immediately build upon the principled understanding of the
trustworthy method established in previous sections, applying it to these new techniques in large
pretrained models, openning up possibilities for many new methods. We also survey the current
existing methods under this perspective.</p>
<p>Finally, we offer a brief summary of the applications of these methods and also discuss about
some future aspects relating to our surve</p>
